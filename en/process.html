  <h1>Process</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    The process begins with the selection of materials. In particular, the
    structure, grain, age and previous use of the wood determine what form
    can be developed from it. The material defines the framework of the
    design – not the other way around.
  </p>

  <h2>Wood</h2>
  <p>
    The wood is shaped primarily through manual wood carving. Cuts,
    material removal and proportions follow the naturally grown state of
    the material. Existing structures, cracks or traces of use are not
    eliminated but consciously revealed and integrated into the object.
  </p>

  <h2>Stone & Base</h2>
  <p>
    Stone and base elements are prepared and shaped by hand. Weight,
    stability and proportion are central considerations. Wood and stone
    are aligned to form a constructive and visual unity – not as contrast,
    but as balance.
  </p>

  <h2>Construction & Electrical Components</h2>
  <p>
    The electrical construction is an integral part of the lighting object,
    yet it is deliberately kept visually unobtrusive. Cable routing runs
    entirely within the wooden body and remains invisible. It serves
    exclusively as power supply and does not influence the external
    appearance of the piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    All electrical components comply with applicable DIN VDE standards and
    are executed in accordance with CE requirements. The components used
    meet the relevant safety regulations for residential and contract use.
    Assembly is carried out professionally, with due consideration given
    to heat development, strain relief and electrical safety.
  </p>

  <h2>Assembly</h2>
  <p>
    In a final step, wood, stone or concrete, light source, electrical
    components and, where applicable, a shade are assembled into a lighting
    object. The result is not a reproducible product, but an independent
    piece that emerges from the relationship between the individual
    components.
