  <h1>Studio</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    In the studio of Trae Lamper, lighting objects are created at the
    intersection of functional use and sculptural presence. The work
    is material-driven and reduced, with form and construction emerging
    directly from the properties of the materials used.
  </p>

  <h2>Working Method</h2>
  <p>
    Each piece is developed and produced in a manual, craft-based process.
    There is no conventional serial production. Material, proportion and
    structural balance determine the design. Irregularities and traces of
    age or previous use are not concealed but deliberately retained.
  </p>

  <h2>Material</h2>
  <p>
    The work primarily uses aged wood, natural stone and metal. The selection
    follows functional and constructive criteria rather than decorative
    intentions. Wood remains visible in its natural structure, stone provides
    mass and stability, and metal fulfils supporting or guiding functions.
  </p>

  <h2>Origin</h2>
  <p>
    The studio is located in the Bergisches Land region of Germany. Many of the
    materials originate from this area, including fruitwoods such as apple,
    cherry and plum, as well as hardwoods like oak and beech. The frequently
    used stone, greywacke, is quarried locally and forms a constructive
    component in many of the works.
